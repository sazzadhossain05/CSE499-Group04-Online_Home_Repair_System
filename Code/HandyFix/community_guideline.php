                          We’ve put together a set of universal guidelines that we believe every community can benefit from and moderators can adopt.
		                  Our goal is to ensure that these sets of guidelines are easy to understand and widely applicable to any community on Handy Fix.
						  It’s not meant to be comprehensive, rather focusing on the most commonly shared principles we believe are critical for setting a 
						  foundation in a community to enable it to thrive.

                                   We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. 
								   These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. 
								   But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.

                                    So, remember to avoid:-<br/>
